# Chess

## Task  - Build a chess app
[Task](Sjakk.pdf)

Does not take into account castling or en passant, as this would require recording what moves have been done previously

In order to play the game, simply runn the file App.py and a visual represenation of the chessboard will be shown as output

When entering moves you enter the square you want to move from and the square you want to move to. Use (A-F) to denote columns and (1-8) to denote rows

Example, scholars mate final move:

White to move

Enter square to move from

F3

Enter square to move to

F7

Checkmate, white won
